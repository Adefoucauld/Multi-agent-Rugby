# Multi-agent-Rugby

This project is aimed to model rugby players attacking and defending during an attack phase.
A multi-agent system approach has been following, using reactive agents and implementing a classic priority order for the behaviour modelization.

This first step into the complete modelisation of rugby behaviours is fully described in the attached report (written in French).
